"""
Translator Agent — everything the platform shows, in the platform language
(the "Target language" line of its config, prompts/translation.md; English
by default).

Search, documents and triage work on the original languages. Once an item
is on the platform — a tender, a news story, a tender document, a live
activity entry — this translates its title, buyer name, document name and
short summary, and writes the notes for tender updates, in small batches
each run. Each translated column records its language (the row's `lang`
map), so after a language change everything out of date is redone. The
website shows only text in the platform language (webapp/lib/english.ts).
(The column names still say _en: they hold the platform-language text.)
