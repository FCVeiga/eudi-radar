"""
Status verification — is an opportunity actually open today?

Triage only sees a search snippet and can't judge dates, so every promoted
opportunity without a structured deadline is checked here before it can show
as active on the site:

- TED notices: read the deadline (or planned date) from the notice's eForms XML.
- Everything else: fetch the source page and have the LLM judge it against
  today's date, quoting its evidence.

Anything that can't be confirmed becomes UNVERIFIED (Database page only).
